Publish Date: some day in 2023

## Introduction

Recently, corporates had been mass-producing trash music every second, while pretending that it took a lot of effort.
The "fanbases" of these pieces of garbage, meanwhile, entirely consist of botted comments and those who are friends with the producers.
This article aims to explain how modern pop music sucks.

---

* Pop music is monotonous. Everything sounds the same.
* Pop music try to be "innovative" by incorporating "rap" lyrics which make no sense, strong autotune whether or not it fits, trash incoherent ungrammatical English lyrics, and more.
* Pop music incorporate overhyped themes such as AI, love, and NFTs.
* Besides these themes, pop music have no other coherent "theme" and is just a mess. They, however, would spawn in a "meaningful theme" out of the incoherent lyrics, so as to make it "deep", apparently.
* Pop music is dissonant at times.
* Pop music sounds too much like advertisement music, probably because they pretty much are. Some are even used in commercials.
* Pop music uses "hip" filler like "yeah", "uh", "nah", etc. This is trash and cringe, and it screams "hi fellow kids".
