And as Michael "Mikaeli" Lee would say, "I am happy." ~~(Just how many times have I made this reference to *Mikaeli Hitting Metal*?)~~

Here's a list of these fursonas:
* ~11/2/2024 Lunar New Year, white cat fursona
  * Though characterised as "畜生", this marks the beginning in fursona representation within TVB
* 7/11/2024 "Lo and Behold" episode, kitsune fursona[^2]
  * Minor character intended to imitate mobile game NPCs; wields a fox plushie. Somehow there is no negative connotation.
* 19/11/2024 TVB celebration, The Return of the White Cat Fursona(TM)[^3]
  * It is revealed that this fursona is a result of the protagonist's schizophrenia during a drama
* 12/1/2025 police infomercial, wolf fursona[^4]
  * Yields a really big hammer to Unalive (TM) those who insult him, but vulnerable to being disconnected from reality when touched by a police officer, forgotten by the universe as he suffers in a room devoid of spacetime while said police officer "logs out"
* 12/1/2025 show, The Return of the White Cat Fursona(TM) plus a sheep/lamb fursona[^5]
  * This is a cameo as part of the cashgrab show "Super", featuring many offbrand products
* 3/2/2025 "Lo and Behold" episode, Fursona in a Nian Fursuit[^6]
  * Depicting a person in a *Nian* costume, i.e. a fursona of another fursona in a fursuit.
* 11/12/2025 "Middle-Aged Man Singing 4", celebrities all wearing animal masks[^7][^8]
  * I am not in favour of pretentious celebrities
