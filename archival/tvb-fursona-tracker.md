> [!WARNING]
> This is a heavy WIP

>Señor, an *n*<sup>th</sup> fursona has hit the TVB Broadcasting centre, where *n* ∈ ℤ<sup>+</sup>.
- me, probably

And as Michael "Mikaeli" Lee would say, "I am happy." ~~(Just how many times have I made this reference to *Mikaeli Hitting Metal*?)~~

Here's a list of these fursonas:
* 2024 Lunar New Year, white cat fursona
  * Though characterised as "畜生", this marks the beginning in fursona representation within TVB
* 2024 "Lo and Behold" episode, kitsune fursona
  * Minor character intended to imitate mobile game NPCs; wields a fox plushie. Somehow there is no negative connotation.
* 2024 TVB celebration, black cat fursona
  * It is revealed that this fursona is a result of the protagonist's schizophrenia during a drama
* 2025 police infomercial, tiger(?) fursona
  * Yields a really big hammer to Unalive (TM) those who insult him, but vulnerable to being disconnected from reality when touched by a police officer, forgotten by the universe as he suffers in a room devoid of spacetime while said police officer "logs out"
* 2025 show, The Return of the White Cat Fursona(TM)
  * This is a cameo as part of the cashgrab show "Super", featuring many offbrand products
* [NEW] 2025 "Lo and Behold" episode, Fursona in a Nian Fursuit
  * Depicting a person in a *Nian* costume, i.e. a fursona of another fursona in a fursuit.
