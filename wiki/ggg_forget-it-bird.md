Go Go Gadget Forget-it Bird, also known as Go Go Gadget 金翅忘記鳥, is a Euclid-class SCP– wait wrong wiki

It is capable of manipulating memory. The object appears as a detailed sculpture of a bird, made of a type of metal with yellow paint over it. Its size is roughly 50 cm³. [citation needed] It possesses the ability to erase someone's memories, making a target forget about anything the user chooses. To activate the ability, the user must simply hold the object and focus on the memory they wish to erase in the target individual's mind. The object will then fly away as if it is a real bird and when the target sees the object, they will have forgotten the desired memory. The object will return to the user's hand upon completion of this process, ready to be used again.

## Documented Examples of its (mis)Usage
1. Two operators of a restaurant had caused a mass outbreak of food poisoning because of its poisoned source of abalone. One of the operators used the object and wanted everyone who ate it to forget about the effects it had on them. Unfortunately, they have gotten away with their crime after their usage of the object.

## Disclaimer
No, this is not real. This concept is stolen from one of TVB's unfunny shows.
