Ng Wong Tat (Chinese: 吳旺達) is presumably a country in East Asia. It *might* be an island and is probably located near Indonesia. It speaks [the Ng Wong Tat Language](/wiki/tvb_ng_wong_tat_language.md) and Cantonese. There is at least one hotel and at least one restaurant[^1543]. The life expectancy is about 35 years old.[^2095]

In the forest area, the most advanced way of transportation is a wood raft, which tends to detach easily when the rope securing them is gone.[^2084] It is also highly illiterate with very few people who can write calligraphy.[^2095] It also has an unstable s**tcoin named the "吳旺達幣" which has increased in price for a while but then became worthless. This phenomenon had been widely likened to the eruption of a volcano and its aftermath cooling down.[^2242]

<!-- Cannot be verified | People there are stronger than usual. -->

### Geography

Ng Wong Tat is divided into two main regions: the forest area and the non-forest area.

The forest is inhabited by dark green/black lizards with CGI glowing red dots, labelled as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_dragon">Komodo dr*gons</a> (probably mislabelled, but I can't be sure), which supposedly eats cockroaches[^2095], although "conveniently" they left out the close-up shot of them in both of their YouTube videos.[^2084]

The highest mountain in Ng Wong Tat is called "小巫山" (Xiao Wu Shan), which is adjacent to "大巫山" (Da Wu Shan). The gap between the two mountains is approximately 4 metres, and both sides are steep cliffs.[^1543]

The forest area is severely underdeveloped, while the non-forest area is more developed.

In Ng Wong Tat there are frequent volcano eruptions, and also an abundance of caves, which is what people use their aimbot for.

### Culture

The culture in Ng Wong Tat includes using <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=aimbot">aimbot</a> in real life (by shooting arrows at random people to indicate interest)[^2061], (Episode 2095) poking someone's face "lightly" as a lighthearted punishment, and (Episode 2084) eating without hands, which supposedly imitates a Komodo dr*gon but is probably scientifically inaccurate.

The work culture is also flawed, with everything striving to be as slow as possible. [^1574]

(Episode 2132) There is a furry community in Ng Wong Tat, where a person in a bear fursuit had once visited a restaurant after a typo in a contract which is supposed to invite a Komodo dr*gon instead. This part, though, is conveniently left undocumented in TVB's YouTube videos.

**多巫**

There is also a ritual named the "多巫", where one would climb Xiao Wu Shan and jump over to Da Wu Shan in order to be promoted to a higher position, which only has a 30% chance of succeeding. If one fails, they will be caught by one of three platforms attached to Xiao Wu Shan, the higher platform causes the person to lose a leg, the middle platform saves the person's life, and the lower platform guarantees death. After succeeding, someone will dance around the person while holding a spear.[^1543]

### Politics

Getting hit by an arrow is equivalent to being engaged.[^2095]

Ng Wong Tat maintains a consulate-general.[^2084]

Because of the questionable state of tourism in Ng Wong Tat, importing sleeping clothes is considered illegal. If someone brings sleeping clothes, they must complete the AC9527 form to report their status daily, ensuring compliance with the regulations. Shoes may also be cut in half to ensure that illegal substances are not hidden inside.[^1543]

Exporting fertilised Komodo dr\*gon eggs is illegal.[^1567]

<!--(Episode I forgot) Ng Wong Tat also has a translation officer who can speak Cantonese, Min Nan, Hakka, among other languages.-->

A komodo stamp is used as a symbolism for the president, and it is made of an unknown material which is unbreakable using a drill or a flamethrower. If the president is involved in a life-threatening incident, until the president is proven to be safe, the officer with the highest rank will become the temporary president.[^2150]


## 豺狼國 *(K\*ngdom of Wolves)*

I apologise if this violates copyright, but this, the Konosuba typeface, may actually be the font. Link to the image: <https://harjit.moe/images/1502563327965.png>

[^2082]K\*ngdom of Wolves (yes I find it cringe), alternatively Cai Lang Guo (Chinese: 豺狼國), transliterated script "`Rᚹ∂𠃌⦛⊄Ｇ ⊄7 ⧖⊄∢⊅叾б`", is a fictional country. English and Cantonese are spoken, and occasionally English is written in <a href="/wiki/tvb_wolf_script.md">a one-to-one cipher of Latin</a>. It might actually be the Konosuba typeface. Despite its name, only one "wolf" inhabits the country, and that "wolf" is actually a German shepherd. The entrance to the K*ngdom of Wolves is marked by a sign which is abnormally close to a steep cliff.

### Geography

The terrain in K\*ngdom of Wolves is mostly flat land, half of which covered by forests. There is a wide path in the middle of the forests devoid of trees. The sole exception is the area close to the entrance, which is a steep cliff which leads to flat land. In a specific area, there is an abundance of small caves which have CGI lava within.

### Culture
Most of the population practice <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=awoo">awoo (wolf howl)</a> all the time[^1], which is an integral part of the culture in K*ngdom of Wolves.

## 獅吼國 *(Shi Hou Guo)*

Shi Hou Guo (Chinese: 獅吼國, also 獅吼共和國) is a republic north of the K\*ngdom of Wolves, and therefore human trafficking exists.[^2082] Presumably it is a major exporter of coconuts.[^1059] They have history books.[^2082]

### Geography

The southern area of the country is a forest and is severely underdeveloped, while the northern area is slightly more developed.[^1059]

### Culture

Most of the population practice <a href="https://youtu.be/q42qi0Nmm24">jurasisi parak (do onomatopoeia of a lion)</a> a lot[^2082][^1], which is an integral part of the culture in Shi Hou Guo as it symbolises peace and politeness, but if overdone, adverse consequences will happen.[^1059] For some reason, chocolate is also seen as a solution to all problems and conflicts.[^1059]

## 幸吾島 *(Hung Island)*

[^0323]Hung Island (Chinese: 幸吾島) is a fictional island country. Apart from English, it also speaks <a href="/wiki/tvb_hung_island_language.md">its own language</a>, which is so advanced it has its own set of swear words. 

### Geography

80% of its land is covered by forests.

## 女兒國 *(Nü Er Guo)*

It coexisted at the same time as Wu Duo Guo and Hao Duo Guo. My lawyer had advised me not to elaborate anymore on this section.

## 吾多國 *(Wu Duo Guo)*

Wu Duo Guo (Chinese: 吾多國) is a fictional country. 28 years ago (presumably relative to 2023) a Superstitious Worship Basin idk what it's called was stolen by someone, which caused a war with Hao Duo Guo named by historians as "荔枝事變". It lasted for roughly ten years, until they realised the fight was all for nothing. It also has this <a href="/wiki/tvb_wu_duo_guo_language.md">language</a> consisting only of swear words.

## 豪多國 *(Hao Duo Guo)*

Hao Duo Guo (Chinese: 豪多國) is a fictional country. Not much is known other than that it used to co-exist with Wu Duo Guo.
