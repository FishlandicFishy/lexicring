Ng Wong Tat (Chinese: 吳旺達) is presumably a country in East Asia. It *might* be an island and is probably located near Indonesia. It speaks <a href="/wiki/tvb_ng_wong_tat_language.md">whatever this language is</a> and Cantonese. There is at least one hotel. (Episode 2084) In the forest area, the most advanced way of transportation is a wood raft, which tends to detach easily when the rope securing them is gone. (Episode 2095) People there are stronger than usual, and thus <sup>[how?]</sup> the life expectancy is about 35 years old. (Episode I forgot) It is also highly illiterate with very few people who can write calligraphy. (Episode 2242) It also has an unstable s**tcoin named the "吳旺達幣" which has increased in price for a while but then became worthless. This phenomenon had been widely likened to the eruption of a volcano and its aftermath cooling down.

### Geography
        Ng Wong Tat is divided into two main regions: the forest area and the non-forest area. (Episode 2084) The forest is inhabited by dark green/black lizards with CGI glowing red dots, labelled as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_dragon">Komodo dr*gons<img src="ext.svg" style="width:12px; height:12px;" alt="(external link)"></a> (probably mislabelled, but I can't be sure), which supposedly eats cockroaches, although "conveniently" they left out the close-up shot of them in both of their YouTube videos. (Episode 1543) The highest mountain in Ng Wong Tat is called "小巫山" (Xiao Wu Shan), which is adjacent to "大巫山" (Da Wu Shan). The gap between the two mountains is approximately 4 metres, and both sides are steep cliffs. The forest area is severely underdeveloped, while the non-forest area is more developed. In Ng Wong Tat there are frequent volcano eruptions, and also an abundance of caves, which is what people use their aimbot for.

        <h3>Culture</h3>
      The culture in Ng Wong Tat includes (Episode 2061) using <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=aimbot">aimbot<img src="ext.svg" style="width:12px; height:12px;" alt="(external link)"></a> in real life (by shooting arrows at random people to indicate interest), (Episode 2095) poking someone's face "lightly" as a lighthearted punishment, and (Episode 2084) eating without hands, which supposedly imitates a Komodo dr*gon but is probably scientifically inaccurate.
        <br>
        (Episode 1574) The work culture is also flawed, with everything striving to be as slow as possible. 
        <br><br>
        (Episode 2132) There is a furry community in Ng Wong Tat, where a person in a bear fursuit had once visited a restaurant after a typo in a contract which is supposed to invite a Komodo dr*gon instead. This part, though, is conveniently left undocumented in TVB's YouTube videos. 
        <br><br>
        (Episode 1543) There is also a ritual where one would climb Xiao Wu Shan and jump over to Da Wu Shan in order to get a specific badge, which only has a 30% chance of succeeding. If one fails, they will be caught by one of three platforms attached to Xiao Wu Shan, the higher platform causes the person to lose a leg, the middle platform saves the person's life, and the lower platform guarantees death.

      <h3>Politics</h3>
      (Episode 2084) Ng Wong Tat maintains a consulate-general. (Episode 1543) Because of the questionable state of tourism in Ng Wong Tat, importing sleeping clothes is considered illegal. If someone brings sleeping clothes, they must complete the AC9527 form to report their status daily, ensuring compliance with the regulations. (Episode I forgot) Ng Wong Tat also has a translation officer who can speak Cantonese, Min Nan, Hakka, among other languages. (Episode 2150) A komodo stamp is used as a symbolism for the president, and it is made of an unknown material which is unbreakable using a drill or a flamethrower. If the president is involved in a life-threatening incident, until the president is proven to be safe, the officer with the highest rank will become the temporary president.
