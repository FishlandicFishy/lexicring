## East Kowloon Line (東九龍綫)

![ ](viaductaqueduct.png)

Map of the East Kowloon Line. [^1][^2]

Also known as "Smart and Green Mass Transit System in East Kowloon"[^1], where "Smart and Green" is a greenwashing marketing ploy. Its length is approximately 7 km[^1][^2], 6 km being viaducts and 1 km being tunnels.[^1] It is estimated to cost HK$262.5 million to conduct the necessary investigation, design and site work for the line.[^1] The line may release in 2034 to 2038.[^2] A suggested Lam Tim North station may arise.[^1]
