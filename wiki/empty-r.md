# Empty R

There have been several occasions where Empty R has arisen.

## Disclaimer

This article is NOT political and I do NOT endorse the horrible crimes the vandals have done.

The same image, but in Chinese.[^2]

The Empty R has arisen on 28th July 2024 to accomodate for large-scale asset renewal work of a tunnel in the Kwun Tong Line[^1]. A limited edition booklet available in both English and Chinese have been published on that day[^3], only available in stations of the Kwun Tong Line, however as of now I am unable to obtain it due to the abundance of scalpers.

## 6th October 2019


Also known as the original Empty R, the severe outage on 6th October 2019 is <sub>*allegedly*</sub> caused by political vandals.
