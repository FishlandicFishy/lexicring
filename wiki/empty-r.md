# Empty R

**Empty R** (Chinese: 空鐵/~~党鐵~~) refers to the MTR when its service is partially disrupted.

Its theme song and national anthem is **Greensleeves**, the same as that of the HKDSE examinations and the Hang Seng Bank.

The latter Chinese translation is political and means "Party Railway".

There have been several occasions where Empty R has arisen.

## Disclaimer

This article is NOT political and I do NOT endorse the crimes the vandals have done.

My reconstruction of the cover of the booklet.[^1][^2]

The Empty R has arisen on 28th July 2024 to accomodate for large-scale asset renewal work of a tunnel in the Kwun Tong Line[^1]. A limited edition booklet numbered `L1384 07/2024` available in both English and Chinese have been published on that day[^2], only available in stations of the Kwun Tong Line, however as of now I am unable to obtain it due to the abundance of scalpers.

## 1st to 9th October 2019

Please refer to [^3].

Also known as the original Empty R, the outages from 1st to 9th October 2019 were caused by political vandals.
