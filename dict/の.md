## Hairy Pottah 🐙lang
1. [n] You write it in the air using a tree branch to summon your fursona while having random birbs[^1] fly away, for some reason idk
2. [n] the act of running over a deer with your Bergentrück™[^2]

**Usage notes:**

You've got to have Patreon to commission your fursona, that's why you have to say "expect patron"

[^1]: Mostly birbs named ["dementias"](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Dementor), sources say they cause depression
[^2]: This is because the fursona is canonically a stag. Probably.
