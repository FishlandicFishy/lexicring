# 67
## Genalphid English

*Also 6-7.*

**Etymology**: From the lyrics of "Doot Doot (6 7)" by Skrilla, which has no meaning until people started associating it with professional basketball player Lamelo Ball's height, which is 6 ft 7 in.[^1]

Note that Skrilla had stated that "67" has no meaning, despite its resemblance to the police radio code "10-67" used to notify a death.

* Inherently a meaningless term.
  * Used as a general non-sequitur.
  * Used as a non-sequitur specifically in counting upwards.
    * Example: "One, two, six seven…"
  * Used as a greeting or farewell.
    * Example: "And also, six seven!"
  * Either six or seven.
