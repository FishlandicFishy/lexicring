# YFGA

 ## English

[n] Not to be confused with the Yukon Fish and Game Association.[^1]

Stands for "YouTube Farm Gang Army", and alternatively "Young Fetuses Getting Angry" or "YouTube Fatherless Gary Army". Troll organisation composed solely of Genalphids who name themselves after Undertale characters, suggesting that they are secretly part of the furry fandom.

This is not friendly fire, ~~though I am actually a furry myself.~~

They typically falsely expose people and pretend to support controversial people (some of them predators) for shock value, intentionally using inaccurate and false information.

Some YFGA members are also part of the [UTTP](uttp.md).[^1]
