# Ⴞ
## Hairy Pottah 🐙lang

Also ⍽.

1. [n] You write it in the air using a tree branch to make a comically large snake turn into an inanimate object I guess
2. [n] You write it in the air using a tree branch to force a random spider to wear skaters I guess

**Usage notes:**

This is ridiculous, that's why you have to say "ridiculous" while writing Ⴞ in the air
