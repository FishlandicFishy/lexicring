# Shorts Wars

## English

[n] Brainrot ARG done at the expense of normal content. Educational shorts are now repurposed as grounds for their meaningless ARG, where people pretend to be themselves while they lie about their USB backups being stolen. Its community is polarised, either obsessed with Shorts Wars or targetting Shorts Wars and its creators excessively; both sides are not to be condoned.
