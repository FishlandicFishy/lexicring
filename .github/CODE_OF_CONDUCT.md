We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind, except in minuscule, necessary amounts if required for
  documentation
* "Ragebait", insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment of any kind
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement

Community leaders may clarify and enforce the above standards of acceptable behavior,
and may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject any content and contributions
that violate the Code of Conduct.
